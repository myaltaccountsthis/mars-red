    /*
     * The exception number is stored in coprocessor 0 cause register ($13)
     * Note: the codes for External Interrupts have been modified from MIPS
     * specs in order to encode two pieces of information.  According
     * to spec, there is one External Interrupt code, 0.  But then
     * how to distinguish keyboard interrupt from display interrupt?
     * The Cause register has Interrupt Pending bits that can be set.
     * Bit 8 represents keyboard, bit 9 represents display.  Those
     * bits are included into this code, but shifted right two positions
     * since the interrupt code will be shifted left two positions
     * for inserting cause code into bit positions 2-6 in Cause register.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Exception Handlers</h1>

    <p>An <i>exception handler</i>, also known as a <i>trap handler</i> or <i>interrupt handler</i>, can easily
        be incorporated into a MIPS program. This guide is not intended to be comprehensive but provides
        the essential information for writing and using exception handlers.</p>
    <p>Exceptions, traps, and interrupts are all distinct from each other, though they use the same
        underlying mechanism. Exceptions are caused by exceptional conditions that occur at runtime
        such as invalid memory address references. Traps are caused explicitly by certain instructions,
        most of which have a mnemonic starting with "<code>t</code>". Interrupts are caused by external devices
        in memory-mapped I/O (MMIO).</p>
    <p>MARS simulates basic elements of the MIPS32 exception mechanism, but many features are not supported.</p>
    <p>When an exception, trap, or interrupt occurs, the following steps are taken by the simulator:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bit 1 of Coprocessor 0 Status (<code>$12</code>) is set.</li>
        <li>Bits 2-6 of Coprocessor 0 Cause (<code>$13</code>) are set to the exception type (see below for the
            list of supported exception types).</li>
        <li>Coprocessor 0 EPC (<code>$14</code>) is set to the address of the instruction that triggered the
            exception or trap, or in the case of an interrupt, the address of the instruction being executed
            when the interrupt occurred.</li>
        <li>If the exception was caused by an invalid memory address, Coprocessor 0 BadVAddr (<code>$8</code>)
            is set to the invalid address.</li>
        <li>Program execution flow jumps to the MIPS instruction at memory location <code>0x80000180</code>.
            Or, if there is no instruction at location <code>0x80000180</code>, MARS will terminate the MIPS program
            with an appropriate error message by default. This address in the kernel text segment is the standard
            MIPS32 exception handler location. The only way to change it in MARS is to change the MIPS memory
            configuration through the <b>Settings &rarr; Memory Configuration</b> dialog.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The following exception causes are used by MARS:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>ADDRESS_FETCH</code> (4) &mdash; Attempted to read memory at an invalid or misaligned address.</li>
        <li><code>ADDRESS_STORE</code> (5) &mdash; Attempted to write memory at an invalid or misaligned address.</li>
        <li><code>SYSCALL</code> (8) &mdash; An exception occurred while executing a <code>syscall</code>
            instruction.</li>
        <li><code>BREAKPOINT</code> (9) &mdash; Encountered a <code>break</code> instruction.</li>
        <li><code>RESERVED_INSTRUCTION</code> (10) &mdash; Encountered an instruction whose opcode is not recognized by
            the instruction set.</li>
        <li><code>ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW</code> (12) &mdash; Arithmetic overflow occurred during addition or subtraction.
            Division by zero does not cause an exception!</li>
        <li><code>TRAP</code> (13) &mdash; Trapped due to a trap instruction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bits 8-15 of Coprocessor 0 Cause (<code>$13</code>) are used to indicate pending interrupts.
        This is used by the <i>Keyboard and Display Simulator</i> tool, for example, where bit 8 represents
        a keyboard interrupt and bit 9 represents a display interrupt. For more details, see the help menu for
        that tool.</p>

    <h2>Writing an Exception Handler</h2>

    <p>There are multiple ways to include an exception handler in a MIPS program:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write the exception handler in the same file as the rest of the program. An example of this is
            presented below.</li>
        <li>Write the exception handler in a separate file, store that file in the same directory as the other
            program files, and assemble using the <b>Run &rarr; Assemble Folder</b> action.</li>
        <li>Write the exception handler in a separate file, store that file in any directory, then open the
            <b>Settings &rarr; Exception Handler</b> dialog, check the checkbox and browse to that file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The exception handler itself should start at kernel text address <code>0x80000180</code> in the standard
        memory configuration (open the <b>Settings &rarr; Memory Configuration</b> dialog to find the address
        if you are using a different layout). Use the directive <code>.ktext 0x80000180</code> to achieve this.</p>
    <p>If you use any general-purpose registers in your exception handler besides <code>$k0</code> and <code>$k1</code>
        (which are reserved for this exact purpose), you should save their original values and restore them after use
        to prevent the "clobbered" register values from interfering with the regular program. Note that this
        includes <code>$at</code>, which is used by many extended instructions! You can save the values either by
        <code>move</code>ing them into <code>$k0</code> / <code>$k1</code>, or by using the stack.</p>
    <p>The exception handler can return control to the program using the <code>eret</code> instruction.
        This will set the Program Counter to the value of Coprocessor 0 EPC (<code>$14</code>), so be sure to
        increment <code>$14</code> by 4 before returning if you want to skip over the instruction that caused
        the exception.</p>
    <p>Use the <code>mfc0</code> and <code>mtc0</code> instructions to read from and write to Coprocessor 0
        registers.</p>

    <h2>Exception Handler Example</h2>

    <p>The sample MIPS program below generates a trap exception, triggering the exception handler.
        After printing a message, the exception handler returns control to the instruction following
        the one that triggered the exception, then the program terminates normally.</p>
    <pre>
    # Regular program code
        <b>.text</b>
    main:
        # Generate a trap exception
        <b>teqi</b>    $zero, 0      # Trap unconditionally

        # Exit the program now that the exception handler has returned
        <b>li</b>      $v0, 10       # "Exit" system call
        <b>syscall</b>               # Exit the program

    # Relevant data for the exception handler
        <b>.kdata</b>
    msg:
        <b>.asciiz</b> "Trap generated"

    # Exception handler code
        <b>.ktext</b>  0x80000180
        # Save the value of $at (typically good practice) using the stack
        <b>addi</b>    $sp, $sp, -4  # Grow the stack by one word
        <b>sw</b>      $at, ($sp)    # Push the value of $at to the stack
        # Save the values of $v0 and $a0 using $k0 and $k1, respectively
        <b>move</b>    $k0, $v0
        <b>move</b>    $k1, $a0

        # Print a message to console
        <b>li</b>      $v0, 4        # "Print String" system call
        <b>la</b>      $a0, msg      # Address of the string to print
        <b>syscall</b>               # Print the string to console

        # Restore the original values of $v0 and $a0
        <b>move</b>    $v0, $k0
        <b>move</b>    $a0, $k1
        # Restore the original value of $at
        <b>lw</b>      $at, ($sp)    # Pop the value of $at from the stack
        <b>addi</b>    $sp, $sp, 4   # Shrink the stack by one word

        # Increment EPC (Exception Program Counter) in order to skip the trap instruction
        <b>mfc0</b>    $k0, $14      # Coprocessor 0 register $14 has address of trapping instruction
        <b>addi</b>    $k0, $k0, 4   # Add 4 to point to next instruction
        <b>mtc0</b>    $k0, $14      # Store new address back into $14
        # Return to the regular program code
        <b>eret</b>                  # Exception return; jump to EPC

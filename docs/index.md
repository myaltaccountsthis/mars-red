# **MARS Red**

MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator

MARS Red is a modern derivative of [MARS](https://dpetersanderson.github.io/)
(MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator), an education-oriented lightweight IDE
for programming in the MIPS assembly language.
For more information about the original MARS, see [History](history/).

The MARS Red IDE provides editing and assembling capabilities, but its real
strength lies in its support for interactive debugging.

- The program can be executed in slow motion or one instruction at a time.
  In addition, the program can be stepped backwards to undo instructions.
- Registers and data in memory are shown and can be modified by hand
  while the program is running.
- Execution breakpoints can easily be added or removed after assembling.
